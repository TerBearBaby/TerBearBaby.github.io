<p>Louis the alien (loo-wee) album is my first album created, involving 4 songs I will be creating. First one is the lore in a nutshell, second one is start of mayhem, third is middle of mayhem, and fourth is last and end of mayhem. The lore is placed in 2050, where NASA spacemen figure out that mars has life, and they travel there to find a French speaking alien, one of the spacemen knows minor French, like welcomings. While the other, knows 0 French, The alien introduces himself saying his name is Louis, whilst on an intercom with other NASA members. One of the spacemen say 'NASA reports, we have found a French alien... he said his name is Louis, I dont know anything else he said, but we are going to bring him back'. He said he will rule the world, but the spacemen didnt know that he did. He was brought to earth and then NASA figured out from DNA he was from a lab in France and was sent into space, he wasnt meant to be made, with the mutated human genes in him he slowly overtook the world, ending all population of human. He had affairs with women with r@pe, and pushed up the population of aliens. Who overtook the world within 20 more years. NASA agents couldnt do anything, due to figuring out that he was from France as he already made a population of 15 within the first year of him on Earth.</p>
